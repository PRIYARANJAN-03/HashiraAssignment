# HashiraAssignment
this repository contains the files that has code given by Hashira int their placement drive.

#Of course. Since the problem states that any language except Python is allowed, here is a complete and robust solution written in JavaScript (for Node.js).
#This solution correctly handles:
 1.Parsing the input JSON.
 2.Converting numbers from any base (2-36) into a format suitable for calculation.
 3.Handling very large numbers that would overflow standard integer types by using BigInt.
 4.Evaluating the polynomial efficiently using Horner's method.
 5.Converting the large results back into the required output base.
 6.Formatting the final output as a JSON object.

#How to Run
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
 1.Save the code above as solve.js.
 2.Save the JSON data as input.json in the same folder.
 3.Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to that folder, and run the command
